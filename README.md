This is an Application system that was created using .NET 8.0 and Visual Studio 2022.

The Application is an ASP.NET MVC that registers employees' working hours during the week, 
the week starts on Monday and Ends on Friday. So basically this system is doing **CRUD operations** with
employeeâ€™s hours and it stores the data in the In-Memory storage( C# List) and you will lose the data once 
the application restarts.

The application is being tested using xUnit Testing and it has 21 methods for testing the EmployeeController.
software that this application is using for doing the test is: **NSubstitute(For Mocking)** and **FluentAssertions**
